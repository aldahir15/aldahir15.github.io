title: (First) Lesson!
---

Welcome!
Just started this blog out of pure boredom and decided I needed to be a bit productive with myself.
I am currently an aspiring Software Engineer, just finished university at UC Irvine, and headed towards the dreaded SF App Academy this July.
I will use this canvas to write about my personal life and explanations about things I learn.
Well if anyone is listening,
See you soon!

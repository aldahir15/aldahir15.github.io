Welcome!
Just started this blog out of pure boredom and decided I needed to be a bit productive with myself.
I am currently an aspiring Software Engineer, and headed towards the dreaded SF App Academy this July.
I will use this canvas to write about my personal life and explanations about things I learn.
Well if anyone is listening,
Talk to you soon!


Here is some Ruby code.

<pre>
  <code class="ruby">
    def Welcome(name)
      puts "Hello #{name}, Welcome to my blog!"
    end
  </code>
</pre>
